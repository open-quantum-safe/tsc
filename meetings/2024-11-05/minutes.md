## Agenda

(see [agenda](./agenda.md))

1. Chair's introduction
2. Approve agenda
3. Appoint minute-taker
 - Christian Paquin
4. Review action items from previous meeting (if any)
 - Douglas to reach out to Max and Brian wrt to PQCA TAC lifecycle; Brian pointed to https://github.com/PQCA/TAC/blob/gh-pages/Processes/Project_Lifecycle.md
5. Appointing a new PQCA TAC representative from OQS
 - Potential candidates: Christian (Microsoft not part of PQCA) and Spencer (more active in project).
 - Spencer would be the better choice, but he's not (yet) part of TSC.
 - Christian offered himself as a back up if the group needs more org diversity on the TAC.
 - Douglas to create a voting poll to elect Spencer to the TSC.
6. Security response team
 - Issue opened for a while: https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/60
 - Identify key people to make up a security initial response team to review issues: Brian, Basil, Michael, Spencer, Douglas volunteered (Pravek would also be a good candidate)
 - Team's goal: respond to submitter, triage, assign issue to code owner, close the loop.
 - How to handle security issues more "safely", with a smaller group with access to the details.
 - Douglas to work with Spencer on a plan; contribute back on issue 60.
7. Regular meeting schedule
 - Suggestion: meet every 5 weeks at the OQS status meeting time during the "off" week; would then alternate between West Coast and Europe friendly times.
8. Other business.
 - Michael asks: how can we meet more productively (closing issues); meet less often or keep a regular cadence? Keep the regular cadence for now; chipping away at tasks.
9. Binary distributions
 - Should we ship binaries? 
10. Channeling external expectations into contributions
 - Should we ship experimental code more rapidly (c.f., https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/pqc-certificates/pull/165)
 - We need to clarify our "promises" which right now are far reaching.
