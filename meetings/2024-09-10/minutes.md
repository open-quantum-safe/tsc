## Minutes

### 3. Appoint minute-taker

Norm Ashley

### 4. Review action items from previous meeting

No action items from last meeting

Trail of Bits’ audit: Draft report distributed and available. Final version forth coming.  Main take-away/finding related to testing in CI processes.

A lively discussion on the lifecycle document. It was observed that the document was approved while there were outstanding issues/feedback.
            
**Action item**: Douglas to reach out to Max and Brian, hear how the open issues will be handled.

### 5. Roadmap Discussion (GitHub issue 1892)

https://github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe/discussions/1892

Various ideas discussed including the need for a definition of production ready code and how to declare this publicly.

Suggested lists of criteria:

- Code ownership
- Project size and number of resources available
- Organization structure (leaders and other roles)
- Having finalized standards based code
- Verification methods
- Need for a security software engineer to help with code reviews from a security point of view
- QA processes
- Release process

Project planning ideas were also discussed mainly, a proposal to create a ‘project board’. The project board would be organized to list, prioritize and categorize issues. Categories would help pinpoint the skillsets best to address each issue.

LF project [Hyperledger](https://github.com/hyperledger/cacti/issues) was suggested as an example to look at.

### 6. Permissions Management

https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/10#issuecomment-2314375179

How to transition people in/out of roles and permissions. Ry from LF outlined his thoughts on organizing  various roles based on the current project needs. This could be managed by creating teams and assigning the appropriate permissions for each team.
Teams list would be updated as people came on or left a team.  Examples: Document; Triage; Owners; Maintainers; Admins; Teams; Release management

### 7. Other business
