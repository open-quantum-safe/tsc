# OQS Project Lifecycle status

*Approved by OQS Technical Steering Committee on TODO.*

The Post-Quantum Cryptography Alliance [Project Lifecycle Policy](https://pqca.github.io/TAC/Processes/Project_Lifecycle.html) describes the stages for technical projects within the PQCA.

The OQS Technical Steering Committee currently considers the Open Quantum Safe project to be at the "Labs Stage" on the "Research Projects" track. 

We recognize that some organizations are relying on OQS in various applications and may be interested in seeing the project advance to the PQCA's Production track. We would welcome increased involvement to grow the contributor and maintainer base to support the efforts required to reach that stage.
