## 1. Status updates

Due to the small number of attendees, the attendees did not iterate through the full list of subprojects.
Instead, the floor was opened for general updates and discussion.

### OQS Technical Steering Committee

There is a TSC meeting next Tuesday, April 1, at 10:00am US Eastern.
It will be held in place of the usual OQS status call.
Among the agenda items is electing the TSC chair and vice-chair.
Nominations are sought in [TSC issue #151](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/151).

### liboqs

liboqs 0.13.0 release candidate 1 is up for review in [PR #2107](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/2107).
So far, the only comments have been related to the release notes, which can be updated at release time without requiring a new release candidate.
Please take a look and offer suggestions or approval.
